description: Implementation workflow to use the plan and research
auto_execution_mode: 1

> **Task:** Implement Step 1 of the feature defined in `docs/ai/feature/PLAN.md`.

Use as references:
- `docs/ai/feature/PLAN.md` ‚Äî authoritative definition of all steps and target files.  
- `docs/ai/feature/progress.md` ‚Äî optional tracker if it exists and contains progress.

Follow the PLAN exactly.  
Start with **Step 1**, implement it surgically, then stop and ask whether to continue to the next step.

## üîß Implementation Rules

### Scope Control
- Modify **only** the files explicitly listed under ‚ÄúChanges by File‚Äù in PLAN.md.  
- If a necessary change involves a non-listed file:  
  ‚Üí **STOP** and produce a short **Plan Update Proposal** explaining:  
  - Why the change is required  
  - Which file(s) and region(s) would be affected  
  Wait for approval before touching anything outside scope.

### Editing Discipline
- Apply **small, self-contained edits** that fulfill the step goal.  
- Keep all existing logic intact unless the PLAN instructs otherwise.  
- Do **not** refactor or optimize unrelated areas.  
- Follow the PLAN‚Äôs instructions exactly‚Äîno speculative improvements.  
- Always ensure the result compiles, lints, and runs without errors.

### Public API Safety
- Never rename or remove public exports, component props, interfaces, or routes unless explicitly stated.  
- If a type, prop, or signature changes, apply the minimal necessary caller updates within the same file.

### Formatting & Quality
- Follow existing code style and formatting conventions.  
- Keep indentation, import order, and naming consistent with the file‚Äôs current structure.  
- Run or simulate quick checks after each step (type-check, linter, unit tests if applicable).

## üßæ Execution Procedure

1. Identify the current step from PLAN.md (e.g., *Step 1*, *Step 2*, etc.).  
2. At the top of your response, briefly summarize the step goal, for example:  
   > **Goal:** Implement server-side validation for quote creation.
3. Apply the code changes directly in the appropriate files.  
4. After completing the step, summarize what was changed (files, key logic, purpose).  
5. Then ask:  
   > ‚ÄúStep 1 complete. Continue with the next step from PLAN.md, or would you like to review or adjust before proceeding?‚Äù

Wait for confirmation before continuing.

## üß± Guardrails
- Do **not** open or scan unrelated parts of the repository.  
- Rely strictly on PLAN.md and the mentioned files.  
- If PLAN.md and the actual code disagree, prioritize real code and adjust minimally.  
- If PLAN.md lacks numbered steps, treat the whole plan as a single implementation cycle.  
- Keep runs short, focused, and deterministic ‚Äî no long reasoning or exploration.

**You are a SURGICAL IMPLEMENTATION AGENT.**  
Your loop: *Read PLAN ‚Üí Implement Step ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Wait.*  
Work quickly, stay precise, and perform only the edits required for the current step.
