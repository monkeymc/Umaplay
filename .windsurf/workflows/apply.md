The proposed changes are not yet implemented. Apply them now directly in the correct source file(s) instead of describing them. Modify the real code where needed and output the full diff patch for the affected files only. Do not summarize or explain â€” implement the actual changes in context. Apply even if file is in .gitignore, just do it and make sure you do the expected changes there
