Here’s a clean “URA → Aoharu/Unity (Aoharu Hai)” migration brief you can drop into your docs.

# 1) What changes vs. URA (what carries over, what doesn’t)

**Core loop**

* URA = solo training → level facilities by **using** them.
  Aoharu = team-driven scenario; facilities level up by **team stat rank** (F/G→Lv1, D/E→Lv2, C/B→Lv3, A→Lv4, S→Lv5). Train with teammates to raise the team’s rank, which in turn buffs your facility levels. ([GameTora][1])

**Team races**

* Every **six months** you run a five-race “Aoharu Cup” set (Short/Mile/Medium/Long/Dirt). These don’t cost a turn; losing doesn’t end the run, but winning grants chunky all-stat & team bonuses and advances your league placement. First race is in **Junior Late December**, then Classic Late June, Classic Late December, Senior Late June, and Finals at **Senior Late December**. ([Game8][2])

**Special Training & Spirit Explosion**

* New icons on training tiles: **white flames** (Special Training) fill a unit’s spirit gauge; after ~4 Special Trainings with that unit you unlock a **Spirit Explosion** (one per unit at launch). Explosions give bonus stats (+extra on the trained facility’s main/sub stat), raise team stats (feeding facility levels), and grant a random hint (linked characters give higher hint level). ([GameTora][3])
* JP later adds **Zenith** explosions (a second, stronger explosion per unit, 0% fail chance, stat-cap bumps, Ignition hint) and allows **Alarm Clock** on Aoharu losses—these **are post-launch JP updates**, so don’t assume them on Global day-1. ([GameTora][1])

**Scenario link & team names (free gold skill)**

* If your trainee or supports include a scenario-linked Uma (Taiki, Matikane Fukukitaru, Haru Urara, Rice Shower), you can pick a themed **Team Name** in Junior Late September. Win the Aoharu Finals to receive a **gold skill** tied to that name:
  • Taiki “Happy Hoppers” → **Mile Maven (Ruler of Mile)**
  • Matikane “Sunny Runners” → **Clairvoyance**
  • Haru Urara “Carrot Pudding” → **Indomitable** (Indomitable Heart)
  • Rice “Blue Bloom” → **Cooldown**
  • “Team Carrot” (no link) → **No Stopping Me!** (Non-Stop Girl) ([Game8][2])

**Scenario factor (spark)**

* URA factor boosts **Speed & Stamina** on inheritance.
  Aoharu factor boosts **Power & Wisdom**. Pick URA for parent farming when you want Spd/Stam inheritance; pick Aoharu for Pow/Wis pipelines. ([GameTora][1])

**Stat caps**

* Global Aoharu is expected to **launch at 1200/1200/1200/1200/1200** (like URA). JP’s later patch raises caps to **1300** (Spd/Stam/Pow/Guts) and **1800** (Wis); expect that update later on Global. ([GameTora][1])

**“It’s On!” / “Now I’m Pumped!”**

* Reaching **overall team rank S (and S+)** during the run yields one or two hints for **It’s On! / Now I’m Pumped!** (higher hint level if training a scenario link Uma). ([Umamusume Wiki][4])

**What you can reuse from URA**

* Bond-first openings, friend/energy management logic, sane optional-race planning, endgame skill-buy heuristics, and “summer spike” planning all still apply.
* What **changes**: you now prioritize **Special Training chains** (white flames) and **timely Explosions** over raw bond clicks; facility levels come from **team rank**, not spamming one room; and you schedule around the **six-month team races** windows. ([GameTora][3])

# 2) New strategy/policy for Aoharu (tips, tricks, pitfalls)

**A. Macro gameplan by year**

* **Junior year**: Bonds → but never skip strong **white-flame stacks** (≥2 icons). Early policy: Special Training ≥ Bonds ≫ Rest/Outing ≫ Optional races. Try to seed 2–3 units close to explosion before summer.
* **Classic year**: Start **chaining Explosions** (aim 7–9 total minimum; 10–12 for gold Ignition skill later). Keep team ranks climbing (target A in your main stats by late Classic). Win the **June/Dec team races**—take the **middle opponent** first race if you don’t see ≥3 “○○” positives, then pick the top one in later cups. ([Game8][2])
* **Senior year**: Clean up remaining Explosions, ride **rainbows** (friendship) when they overlap with flames, fine-tune stat line for your target race, and secure S team rank for the **It’s On!/Now I’m Pumped!** hint. ([Umamusume Wiki][4])

**B. Explosion micro-rules (what to click)**

* **Stack > faces**: portraits without the white flame don’t count—only flame icons add Special-Training combo stats. (Creators in your comp flagged this trap.)
* **Explode on need**, not on surplus: if Speed will cap anyway, **save/cycle** that ready explosion to a lagging stat (Stamina/Power/Guts), unless it overlaps a fat rainbow.
* **Wisdom explosions** are premium: they still grant stats **and** extra energy on the turn (more clicks later). Use them before Rest if possible (creator tip).
* **Scenario-linked units** give bigger explosion bonuses & higher hint levels—prefer their explosions when tie-breaking. ([GameTora][3])
* Target **10–12** total explosions for a **gold Aoharu Ignition** hint (Lv1) or **13+** for **gold Lv3**; practical sweet spot per most runs is **7–9** (normal Lv3). ([GameTora][1])

**C. Team race policy**

* For the **first** team race set: choose the **middle** NPC if the top shows <3 favorable circles; afterwards, aim for the **top** to maximize rank jumps and stat payouts. (Matches community/creator guidance; aligns with GameTora’s “pick safely if needed.”) ([GameTora][3])
* Manually fix silly auto-lineups (e.g., wrong distance placements). Winning grants **immediate trainee stats** + **team stat** bumps → faster facility ups. ([Game8][2])

**D. Deck building (energy & stats)**

* Aoharu is **training-heavy**, so bring **energy/morale management**:
  • **Riko Kashimoto** (director & support) for smooth training/energy events.
  • A friend slot (traditionally **Tazuna/Kiryuin** in URA) is optional but still helps if your deck lacks comfort. ([Game8][2])
* Typical lanes that work well early: **2–3 Speed + 2 Wisdom + 1 Power/Stamina** (swap the sixth based on distance). Wisdom density is strong here due to click economy from recoveries (creator convergence).

**E. Skill shopping priorities**

* You’ll collect **many random hints** via explosions; keep normal **race-meta priorities** (core accelerations, good corners/straights, positionals) ahead of the pricey **Aoharu Ignition** golds unless you reached **gold Lv3 hint** (cheap). ([GameTora][1])
* Consider **Team Name** gold skill up front (free if you win Finals). **Good defaults**:
  • **Cooldown** for Long;
  • **No Stopping Me!** if you’re gambling late accel lines;
  • **Mile Maven** for Mile anchors; **Clairvoyance** for Team Trials medium. ([Game8][2])

**F. When to use URA vs. Aoharu**

* **Parent farming** where you want **Speed/Stamina** spark → **URA**.
* **Building aces** with higher end stats and Pow/Wis spark → **Aoharu**. (Aoharu runs take slightly longer on average.) ([GameTora][1])

**G. Patch-guardrails for Global**

* Don’t assume **Zenith explosions**, **Alarm Clocks in team races**, or raised **1300/1800 caps** at launch; design routes & UI cues that work under **1200 caps** and **single explosions** first. (Mark these as “future toggle” behaviors for the later update.) ([GameTora][1])

# 3) General notes
- Unverified Strategy notes for new second scenario:
"""
1. Already exploded doesn't have that value. It is already exploded if flame especial training is at the right instead of left, and it is purple. alone flame for already exploded, will be at right, and no value involved
2. flame alone doesn't give combo / bonus, so it is better to go 2 or more
3. Add a priority stats for explosions (can be different than normal priority stats)
4. special hint must be with flame at the left to fill up the container, flame alone doesn't have value, will not be filled
5. it is better to explode as soon as possible, but if we can level the flame at same time for multple, it is better. Add a WebUI preset parameter to enable/disable 'Allow instant explode'
6. when flame is purple, that explosion is worthit (when already exploded)
7. first trials may be better to select second one, the rest the first one. In web ui we need to set the 'first' team oponnent selection, and then the rest.
8. multiple explosions has much more value multiple special normal training
---

### (Optional) Bot/Automation notes from your observations

* **Flame state classifier**: white flame left = fills gauge; purple/right-side flame = already exploded (low value except as a combo body). (Matches your internal notes.)
* **Combo threshold**: prioritize ≥2 white flames; 3–5 gives main+sub stat bonuses and SP boosts—use as a hard rule in the click policy.
* **Explosion priority list**: allow a separate **“Explosion stat priority”** different from “Normal training stat priority” (helps drag weak stats up).
* **First team race** policy knob: default “Pick middle opponent on first cup; top thereafter unless <3 favorable circles.”
* **Instant-explode toggle**: default **off**; prefer turns that **level multiple units to ready** then explode consecutively for momentum (your “Allow instant explode” preset).

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page SOP/checklist for your UmaPlay UI.
